# p1.5

This folder contains p1, completed as part of my Revature training curriculum. 

# Languages/Libraries/Frameworks Used:
Frontend: HTML, CSS, Javascript, Bootstrap
Backend: Java, Servlets, JDBC, tomcat, OracleDB

This project was intended to be an extention of p0. In p0, we designed a console based banking app, and in p1, we designed a web-based frontend for the app.

I learned how websites communicate to the database and general best practices. In the future, I would like to implement a better, more comprehensive, validation system. Additionally, I will utilize tests and logging.
